# SIMUROSOT ROBO CHANLLENGE 

--------

<br>
This is the 2017 FIRA SIMUROSOT ROBO CHANLLENGE environment<br>

OS: ubuntu 16.04<br>
ROS: Kinectic<br>

##### :exclamation:You must not install the OS on a(any) Virtual Machine, otherwise there will be a lot of problems.:exclamation:

## 1. Install the ROS:<br>
You can go to:  http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu
for how to download the ROS Kinetic version.<br>
Here we copy some of the proceed below:<br>

1. Setup your sources.list

```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
```
2. Setup your keys
```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116
```
3. Installation
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
```
4. Initialize rosdep
```
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```
5. Environment setup
```
echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 2. Turtlebot & Gazebo Package
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-turtlebot-gazebo
```
   
## 3. SIMUROSOT-ROBOCHALLENGE
### 3.1 Download this project
### 3.2 Add the modles
In your home directory, Press Ctrl+H to show the hidden directory, then go to gazebo/models sub-directory. Copy the colorbox, models/newbox and models/newfield to this directory.

### 3.3 Run the program <br>
```
python ./start.py 1 1
```

If you see the figure as follow, you are success.

## 4. File Explain 
### 4.1 The file structure 

./ros_scripts<br>
├── how_to_run.py<br>
├── robot.py<br>
├── start.py<br>
└── world.world<br>

## 4.2 detail explain for the file
#### 1. start.py
This is the start-up script. When it is running, it will start all the necessary program. After start, the Turtlebot will act according to what defined in the how_to_run.py script.
#### 2. how_to_run.py
This script define how the turtlebot act. There is only one function "Run" in this script, The function has a "robot" parameter, which is an object of class "Robot". In this object, some act are define for manipulate the Turtlebot. The "start.py" script will be called by start-up script, and also tranfer the "robot" object.

#### 3. robot.py
The script define a "Robot" class, which wrap some basic function for the manipulation of turtlebot.<br>
set_move_speed(met_per_sec)　: Set the speed of turtlebot，dimension is m/s.<br>
set_turn_speed(deg_per_sec)　: Set the rotate speed of turtlebot, dimension is degree/s.<br>
go_forward(seconds)　　　　 : Let the turtlebot move for "seconds" seconds at the given speed.<br>
turn_around(seconds)　　　　: Let the turtlebot turn around for "seconds" seconds at the given rotate speed.<br>
get_image()　　　　　　　　: Get the current image from camera. The image contain the RGB information as a 2D matrix.
#### 4. world.world
This file define the enviroment which include play field and obstacles. It will be called by "start.py" script. We have defined some more testing enviroment in the "world" sub-directory. You can use them for testing. 

## 4.3 More to do
The given demo is really simple for beginners to start up. You can define more sophisticate function based on "robot.move_cmd" and "robot.turn_cmd" to set. And using "robot.cmd_vel.publish(robot.move_cmd)" to publish you manipulation. Such as simulatanious turn around and moving.
